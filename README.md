# Hit Banana
My first android app.  A stupid game but it allowed me to get my feet wet with a few basics.

### The name of the game is also the instructions: Hit Banana.
Meaning, when the button says "BANANA", hit it.

If you miss, that's a fail.

If you hit something that isn't "BANANA", that's another fail.

Game ends when you've accumulated 3 fails.

Your score is just the count of milliseconds you lasted before failing 3 times.

#### Minimum android version is Marshmallow (API 23).
