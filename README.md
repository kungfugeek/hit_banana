# Hit Banana
My first android app.  A stupid game but it allowed me to get my feet wet with a few basics.

### The name of the game is also the instructions: Hit Banana.
+ Meaning, when you see a banana, hit it.

+ If you miss, that's a fail.

+ If you hit something that isn't a banana, that's also a fail.

+ Game ends when you've accumulated 3 fails.

+ Your score is just the count of milliseconds you lasted before failing 3 times.

#### Minimum android version is Marshmallow (API 23).
